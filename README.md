# Building a Netflix-Like Streaming App with React Native

**A Journey in Mobile Development**

In the ever-evolving world of mobile apps, creating a streaming platform akin to Netflix is both a challenging and rewarding endeavor.
As developers, we set out to build a Netflix-like app using **React Native**, a powerful framework for cross-platform mobile development.
This blog chronicles our journey in developing this app—highlighting its features, technologies used, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## Project Overview

The goal was to develop a mobile app that mimics the core functionalities of Netflix, including a user-friendly interface, video streaming, and search capabilities.

### Key Features

* **Home Screen**
  A visually appealing landing screen featuring:

  * A featured movie titled **"Drawing Closer"**
  * Horizontal lists of movies and series
  * A built-in search bar for easy navigation

* **Video Playback**
  Video streaming powered by **Mux**, with working titles including:

  * *Drawing Closer*
  * *Queen of Tears Episode 1*

* **Search Functionality**
  Users can search using keywords like `queen`, `tears`, or `ep 1` to retrieve *Queen of Tears Episode 1*

* **Authentication**
  User authentication and sign-out managed via **Supabase**

## Achievements

The project successfully delivered a working Netflix-like streaming app featuring:

* Reliable video streaming for two titles
* Robust search supporting partial queries
* Seamless authentication integrated with Supabase

---

## Future Enhancements

To take the app to the next level, we plan to:

* **Dynamic Content**
  Use Supabase to fetch movies and series dynamically

* **Native Video Playback**
  Switch to `react-native-video` for improved performance and flexibility

* **Advanced Search**
  Implement fuzzy search or server-side querying to improve results

* **User Profiles**
  Add support for multiple user profiles, a signature Netflix feature

## Conclusion

This project was undertaken by **Dupchu Wangmo** and **Tandin Om** during the **Spring Semester 2025** for the course **SWE201**.

It was a valuable opportunity for us to apply concepts learned during lectures and practicals. We gained hands-on experience in mobile development, authentication, video integration, and app design—all while creating something fun and functional.
